### Hola Amigos ðŸ‘‹

I like making things and transforming messy parts to be neat as a new pin!

I'm a hybrid; a web developer, a calligrapher, and a painter.  
Most likely, you have guessed it right. I'm into client-side more than the other side of the lake.

Through the past year, I've been working on the technicalities of the _MERN stack_, but for the upcoming months I will draw my focus on:

- Performance, clean code, design patterns
- Investing more in my creative side (UI-wise)
- Interested in making Design Systems

**P.S.** If you are interested into my artistic side, have a look here <a href="https://www.instagram.com/m.hossameldine/" title="Follow me on Instagram"> <img alt="Follow me on Instagram" src="https://img.icons8.com/dusk/64/000000/instagram--v1.png"/> </a>
