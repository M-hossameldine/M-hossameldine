### Hola Amigos 👋

I like making things and transforming messy parts to be neat as a new pin!

I'm a hybrid; web developer, calligrapher, and painter.  
Most likely, you have guessed it right. I'm into client-side more than the other side of the lake.

Through the past year, I've been working on the technicalities of the _MERN stack_, but my agenda for the upcoming months:

- Draw more focus onPerformance, clean code, design patterns
- Invest more time into my creative side (UI-wise)
- Interested in making Design Systems
